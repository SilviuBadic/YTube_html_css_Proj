# YouTube Layout Remake

This is one of my first projects as a developer. I've been focused on the markup language HTML. I put into practice some basic HTML concepts, together with adding some CSS rules over it. Here I've tried to remake the YouTube interface by maintaing the same fonts, colors, text sizes, the spaces between elements. I've added a few pictures from my trips as well, in order to give it a custom look.

Other than practicing with DIVS, It was the first time working with flexbox, as well as implementing the CSS @media rule and the relative and absolute positions.

## Lessons Learned

As I mentioned in description, I managed to learn the first steps as a front end developer. I've improved my skills in HTML and CSS. 

A first challenge was to easily display my main titles into three columns and to create the sidebar. I manage to overcome this by using flexbox (display grid & display flexbox). Another challenge was to mantain a nice layout even when narrowing the screen or using a bigger device. I managed to overcome this by using and learning new things about @media.

It was a good starting point to understand the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand the basics of HTML and CSS, and to start some new fun and interesting projects.
